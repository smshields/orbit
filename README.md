## Orbit

Orbit is a visual synthesizer that leverages the left side of your computer keyboard to create "planets" and make sounds. It's an exploratory experience, built on WebGL and P5.js. It was done as a homework assignment in response to a prompt asking to create an instrument.

The camera zooms by intersection volumes, who pulse to your sound. Strange collisions of angle, curve, and color fill your eyes.

### Notes

Active Keys are:

qwert
asdfg
zxcvb

No other keys are used. The currently notes are set to the 1,3,5,7,9 of a C minor scale. Octaves increase as you go down the keyboard. 

It's meant to be contemplative and reverberative. The synth sound is currently the default voice of the P5.sound library's monosynth.

Things I recommend trying:

1. Arpeggios: qwert - asdfg - zxcvb forward and back, quickly and at different tempos
2. Cross-Octave Chords: Experiment with cross row/column notes and see what sounds you create. You can get some really retched distortion. Also some heavenly chords.
3. Improvising: Find a drum beat and play
4. Bring a Friend in: Have your partner(s) or friend(s) control the keyboard by sound/sight alone while you experience the opposite. 
5. Project it on a wall: I'd love to see a picture 

### Usage

Don't orbit and drive. Feel free to clone/branch and build on this. I may come back to it eventually.
